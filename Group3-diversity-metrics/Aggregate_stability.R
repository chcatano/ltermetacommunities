# local scale temporal variability
# temporal variability of the ith community is calculated as the coefficient of temporal variation of its biomass

# mubar is the spatial average of the temporal mean of local community biomass

## spatial average of the standard deviation of local community biomass
sqrtwbar <- mean(sigi) 
# We now compute spatial variability as:

## ----------------------------------------------------- ## 
## Components of spatial variability                     ##
## ----------------------------------------------------- ##
## Spatial variability, CVS2, arises from two factors: biomass unevenness among sites 
## and asynchronous dynamics among sites
## 1. Spatial biomass uneveness = any spatial or interspecific variation in the mean and/or variance
## of biomass. It can result from spatial heterogeneities in site properties (size, fertility, ...)
## CVS2.uneven can be computed When the dynamics of all patches are perfectly correlated 
## i.e. correlation between any two patches = 1 (wij = sqrt(wii*wjj))
## CVS2 is solely caused by spatial unevenness and equals:
CVS2.uneven <- 1/(s*mubar^2)*(sum((mui - mubar)^2 + (sigi - sqrtwbar)^2))

## 2. Spatial biomass asynchrony = results from spatially asynchronous dynamics among sites
## arises in homogeneous metacommunities where all sites have identical mean and variance of biomass,
## the additional asynchronous term equals:
CVS2.asyn <- 1/(mubar^2)*(sqrtwbar^2 - ((1/s^2)*Covsum))

## ----------------------------------------------------- ## 
## Linking variability across multiple scales            ##
## multiplicative and additive partitionning             ##
## ----------------------------------------------------- ##
## We define the squared coefficients of variation at regional scale as gamma variability
GammaCV <-  CVM2
## We define the squared coefficients of variation at local scale as alpha variability
AlphaCV <- CVL2

## 1. multiplicative partitionning of metacommunity stability
## GammaCV = AlphaCV / Beta1
## with Beta1 = 1/phi the spatial asynchrony-related variability
## phi is the index of spatial synchrony which serves as a scaling factor that scales temporal variability from local 
## to regional scales (phi = CVM2/CVL2). The more local communities fluctuate synchronously, the higher the variability of the metacommunity.
## phi takes values between 0 and 1
phi <- Covsum/((sum(sigi))^2)
## should verify phi = CVM2/CVL2 
# round(phi, 4) == round(CVM2/CVL2, 4)
Beta1 <- 1/phi ##  spatial asynchrony-related variability

res <- data.frame(cat=c("Gamma", "Alpha", "Beta"), val=c(GammaCV, AlphaCV, Beta1))
