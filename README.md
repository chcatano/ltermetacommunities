#LTER Metacommunity Synthesis Working Group  

The purpose of this site is to promote collaboration within the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) working group on Metacommunities. This page will serve as a repository for code and results for ongoing analyses of LTER metacommunity data sets.  
####Background  
This working group initially met at the LTER All Scientists Meeting (ASM 2015), which took place from 30 August through 2 September 2015. We are currently supported (2016-2018, [link](http://intranet2.lternet.edu/content/congratulations-2016-round-1-synthesis-working-groups)) by the LTER National Communications Office (NCO).
